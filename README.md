# Getting-to-philosophy

Exploring the Wikipedia's philosophy phenomena 


## Project description

Project is about exploring how many hops does it take from random wiki link to reach the philosophy page. I also gather statistics such as: 

* Average number of hops 
* Percentage of random pages that land to philosophy page
* Reducing the number of http requests using **hashing**


## Code description

* wikipedia_philosophy.py : Finds above mentioned statistics of given number of random pages. Number of random pages is provided as an external argument.
* wikipedia_philosophy_hashing.py : It performs the same operation as above but with **hashing**
* test.py : It allows user to count the number of hops from the link provided the user
